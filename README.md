## Basic Idea <a name="basic-idea"></a>

The project aims to track funds hierarchically, starting from the central government down to the common man. It involves four hierarchical components: Central government, state government, contractors, and resource providers/dealers. The process includes budget allocation, project proposal, fund requests, tender opening, bidding, inspection, and fund transfer.

## Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - HTML/CSS: Markup and styling
  - Redux (optional): State management library for React applications
  - Bootstrap or Material-UI: UI framework for responsive design

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic
  - Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data
  - Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js

- **Blockchain**:
  - Ethereum Blockchain: Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source, blockchain-based software platform that runs its own cryptocurrency, ether. It allows Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (Apps) to be designed and run without the risk of downtime, fraud, control, or third-party intervention.
  - Solidity: Solidity is a high-level, object-oriented programming language for smart contract implementation. It's inspired by C++, Python, and JavaScript, and it's designed for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
  - Web3: Web3 is a collection of JS libraries that allows you to communicate with an Ethereum node either remotely or locally. Simply, it provides us with an API from which we can conveniently interact with the blockchain.
  - Ganache: Ganache is a component of the Truffle Suite, a set of development tools that allows users to simulate blockchain environments and evaluate smart contracts locally.
  - MetaMask: It is a cryptocurrency wallet that uses software to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides users with access to their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to communicate with decentralized applications.

## Proposed System <a name="proposed-system"></a>

The proposed system streamlines various aspects of government fund allocation and project execution through efficient processes and blockchain integration.

### Budget Allocation
After the budget is finalized in the parliament, the Finance Ministry takes charge of entering the details and allocating funds for different departments. Through the web application, state governments can propose projects and request funds. This streamlined process enables transparency and accountability as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain. Once a project proposal is approved, funds are allocated accordingly.

### State Government Opens Tenders
Upon receiving sanctioned funds, the state government initiates the project execution phase by opening tenders through an online portal. This portal, known as E-tender, provides a platform for contractors to submit their bids. By leveraging technology, the system ensures fair and competitive bidding processes.

### Bidding Process
Contractors participate in the bidding process by submitting their bids within a specified deadline. Bids are opened in the presence of selected officers and representatives of contractors to maintain transparency and fairness. The contract is typically awarded to the lowest bidder, ensuring cost-effectiveness in project execution.

### Inspection
To monitor project progress and ensure quality control, an inspection committee conducts periodic site visits. The committee verifies the progress and submits detailed reports to higher officers. If the progress meets the predefined standards and requirements, transactions are carried out through smart contracts. These transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of fund disbursement.

### Successful Transfer of Funds
Illustrations within the system demonstrate the successful transfer of funds from the state government to contractors. By showcasing transparent and auditable transactions, the system instills trust among stakeholders and ensures that funds are utilized efficiently for project execution.

Overall, the proposed system leverages modern technologies and efficient processes to facilitate transparent, accountable, and effective management of government funds and project execution. Through blockchain integration and streamlined workflows, the system aims to mitigate corruption, enhance efficiency, and promote public trust in government initiatives.
